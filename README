A TiddlyWeb[1] plugin which provides a Whoosh[2]-based indexing and
search interface. Requires tiddlyweb 1.2.x.

The plugin:

* Depending on configuration replaces the search interface of the store
  that is in use (if any) or adds an additional search URI.
* Automatically updates the index when a new tiddler is written to 
  the store.
* Provides twanager commands for reindexing the entire store, and
  making command line searches of the index.

See the module documentation for installation and configuration
instructions: pydoc tiddlywebplugins.whoosher

Whoosher can also work with tiddlywebplugins.dispatcher.
