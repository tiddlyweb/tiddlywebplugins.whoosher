A TiddlyWeb[1] plugin which provides a Whoosh[2]-based indexing and
search interface.

The plugin:

* Replaces the search interface of the store that is in use (if any).
* Provides a system for structured queries of the index.
* Automatically updates the index when a new tiddler is written to 
  the store.
* Provides twanager commands for reindexing the entire store, and
  making command line searches of the index.

See the module documentation for installation and configuration
instructions: pydoc tiddlywebplugins.whoosher

* Explore methods for dynamically managing the schema.
  The Whoosh docs suggest that adding fields can be done
  on the fly.
